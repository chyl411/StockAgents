# Due Diligence Data Packs

## Instructions
When building a DD data pack:

1. **Define transaction and thesis**
   - Deal type (minority/majority/credit), timeline, key risks to prove/disprove.

2. **Create a data room index**
   - Categorize: Corporate, Financial, Commercial, Legal, Tax, HR, Ops, IT/Security, ESG.
   - For each item: owner, status (requested/received/validated), version/date.

3. **Evidence mapping**
   - Every key claim must map to at least one primary document and a citation locator (page/table/section).

4. **Question list (structured)**
   - Write questions as: *Question → Why it matters → Data needed → Who answers → Follow-up test*.
   - Maintain an “open items” tracker.

5. **Red flags & mitigations**
   - Separate: confirmed vs suspected.
   - Propose mitigation: price adjustment, covenant, reps & warranties, integration plan.

## Output Template
- Executive DD Summary (top 10 items)
- Data Room Index (with statuses)
- Key Findings by Workstream
- Open Questions Tracker
- Red Flags Register (severity, likelihood, mitigation)
- Evidence Map (claim → source)

## Quick Checks
- [ ] Each conclusion has a cited source
- [ ] Open items are explicitly listed (no silent gaps)
- [ ] Confirmed vs suspected risks separated
